# Pygame Blob

## Skills Assessed
- Solving problems with… 
    - Creating Classes
    - Create instances 
    - Using inheritance
    - Overriding methods 
    - Importing modules 
    - Using dunder methods

## Goals
Python is such a versatile language. We can create APIs, do data analysis, build web apps, and create games! In this project, we will use OOP to build a game in pygame. 

**What is pygame?**

Pygame is a library that allows developers to create games using Python.
To provide a better visual picture of OOP, we’ll be creating a mini-game of blobs!

## Project

Pyblobs will be a **2-day project**. The first day will consist of a tutorial which can be done independently. The second day will consist of working in pairs to extend the project made from the tutorial.


## Tutorial

The tutorial will be done independently on day 1 of the project. We'll follow this tutorial on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/object-oriented-programming-introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/). 


## Initial Set Up

To create our game we will use **repl.it**, a browser based IDE. Repl allows developers to create and run mini applications in the browser. We highly suggest [creating an account](https://repl.it/signup) with Repl using your github credentials. This will allow you to create repositories and commits to Github using Repl's interface. 

For a more collaborative experience, we also suggest using repl's multiplayer feature to have you and your partner edit on the same repl together. To use multiplayer mode, click "Share" on the top right, a pop-up window should appear with the invite tab open. Type in your partners username and click 'invite'. 


## Getting Started with Pygame 

1) Download the Pygame library in the packages section. 
2) Once you see a `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` file appear in the Packager files section on repl.it you are ready to start the tutorial!

## Tutorial Waves
The [tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/object-oriented-programming-introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/) will be 9 lessons seperated into the following waves:

### Wave 1 - Create one single moving blob
- [Introduction to OOP](https://pythonprogramming.net/object-oriented-programming-introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/)
- [Creating Environment for Object with Pygame](https://pythonprogramming.net/creating-pygame-environment-intermediate-python-tutorial/)

### Wave 2 - Create many moving blobs
- [Many blobs - OOP](https://pythonprogramming.net/many-blob-objects-intermediate-python-tutorial/)
- [Blob Class and Modularity OOP](https://pythonprogramming.net/class-object-modularity-intermediate-python-tutorial/)
- [Inheritance - OOP](https://pythonprogramming.net/inheritance-object-oriented-programming-intermediate-python-tutorial/)

### Wave 3
- [Decorators in Python](https://pythonprogramming.net/decorators-intermediate-python-tutorial/)
- [Operator Overloading](https://pythonprogramming.net/operator-overloading-intermediate-python-tutorial/)
- [Detecting collisions](https://pythonprogramming.net/detecting-collisions-intermediate-python-tutorial/)
- [Special Methods, OOP, and Iteration Python](https://pythonprogramming.net/special-methods-iteration-intermediate-python-tutorial/)


## Pair Project Waves

Now that we have a functioning game, let's use what we learned about OOP to expand Pyblobs. Work with your partner to execute Wave 1 and Wave 2. Both waves can be executed a variety of ways and breaking down each feature into sub-problems is highly encouraged. Feel free to get as creative as you want with these next waves:

### Wave 1

**Make blobs bounce off of the walls.** Alter the `move` function in `Blobs` so that when a blob touches a wall, it will move towards the opposite direction.

### Wave 2

**Create another class of Blob**. When one blob touches a 'collectable' blob, make the collectable blob grow in size.
