# Pygame Blob

## Skills Assessed
- Solving problems with… 
    - Creating Classes
    - Create instances 
    - Using inheritance
    - Overriding methods 
    - Importing modules 
    - Using dunder methods

## Goals
Python is such a versatile language. We can create APIs, do data analysis, build web apps, and create games! In this project, we will use OOP to build a game in pygame. 

**What is pygame?**

Pygame is a library that allows developers to create games using Python.
To provide a better visual picture of OOP, we’ll be creating a mini-game of blobs!

## Tutorial

This project will be a **pair project**. In pairs, we'll follow this tutorial on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/object-oriented-programming-introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/). We'll work with our partner to debug, explore the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), and add own creative twist! 
This project should 2 days to finish and a link with the finished project will be submitted as a pair. 

## Initial Set Up

To create our game we will use **repl.it**, a browser based IDE. Repl allows developers to create and run mini applications in the browser. We highly suggest [creating an account](https://repl.it/signup) with Repl using your github credentials. This will allow you to create repositories and commits to Github using Repl's interface. 

For a more collaborative experience, we also suggest using repl's multiplayer feature to have you and your partner edit on the same repl together. To use multiplayer mode, click "Share" on the top right, a pop-up window should appear with the invite tab open. Type in your partners username and click 'invite'. 


## Getting Started with Pygame 

1) Download the Pygame library in the packages section. 
2) Once you see a `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` file appear in the Packager files section on repl.it you are ready to start the tutorial!
