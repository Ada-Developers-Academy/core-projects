# Instructor: Midpoint

The midpoint was built by using this repo, which is separate from the project repo:

[https://github.com/AdaGold/task-list-api_midpoint](https://github.com/AdaGold/task-list-api_midpoint)

The important part here is a change in `test.sh`, which now has the line:

```
pytest tests/test_wave_01.py tests/test_wave_02.py tests/test_wave_03.py
```

This repo is _not_ a fork of the original project.

### !callout-danger

## Repos May Diverge

If there are significant changes to [the original project](https://github.com/AdaGold/task-list-api), we may need to update this repo in order for the midpoint to be relevant.

### !end-callout

The rest of the files were deleted (like project description and tests) only to make it clear about the scope.
