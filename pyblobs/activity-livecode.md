# Activity: Pyblob Refactor Livecode

**General**:

- What is refactoring and why is it useful?

**Livecode**: 

- A lot of the logic for blobs is found in main.py, how and why should we move that logic into the `Blobs` class instead?

- Let's look at the implementation of `check_bounds`.

- Let's make the a new blob class and make it bounce off of the walls using method overriding of `move` and `check_bounds`.

**Pair Project**:

- Let's split into groups and set up Multiplayer in replit.
