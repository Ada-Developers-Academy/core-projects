# Pyblobs

Today's roundtable will be focused on reviewing the Pyblobs tutorial.

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:
    - Whenever possible, you should follow the Ada Online Communication Norms 
    - You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
    - Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
    - Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try.)
    - When discussing code, we encourage you to use screen sharing through Zoom.
    - Take notes!

- Let's make the a new blob class and make it bounce off of the walls using method overriding.

**Pair Project**:

- Let's split into pairs and set up Multiplayer
