**Roundtable Agenda**:

General:
- (Optional) Greet class and take attendance with Pyblobs window open to set the theme of the roundtable.

LiveCode:
- Instructor does a LiveCode with this [starter kit](https://repl.it/@audreyandoy/pyblobsroundtablestarter#main.py) of how to refactor
- Goal is to refactor draw_environment function.
- And highlight notes of key topics
- Separation of concerns
- New Class and Method Overriding: Green blobs will move much faster than blue blobs and will move in the opposite direction after touching a wall. To do this, we will use method overriding to change the `move` and `check_bounds` methods in the Green Blobs class.
