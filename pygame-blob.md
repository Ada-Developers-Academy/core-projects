# Pygame Blob

## Skills Assessed
- Solving problems with… 
    - Creating Classes
    - Create instances 
    - Using inheritance
    - Overriding methods 
    - Importing modules 
    - Using dunder methods

## Goals
Now that we’ve learned about OOP, let’s utilize it in a more visual way using Pygame!
Python is so versatile. We can create APIs, do data analysis, build web apps, and create games! 

**What is pygame?**

Pygame is a library that allows developers to create games using Python.
To provide a better visual picture of OOP, we’ll be creating a mini-game of blobs!

**Tutorial**

This project will be a **pair project**. In *pairs*, we'll follow this tutorial on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/object-oriented-programming-introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/). We'll work with our partner to debug, explore the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), and add your own creative twist to your project! 
This project should 2 days to finish and a link with the finished project will be submitted as a pair.
